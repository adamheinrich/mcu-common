# MCU-Common

MCU-Common is a library which contains modules useful for embedded programming
(especially for bare-metal microcontroller applications):

- [FIFO][fifo] (first in, first out) queue implementation
- [Logger][logger] module with deferred processing (no more `printf` in
  interrupt handlers!)
- [Critical section macros][critical] for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers

For more information, see [API documentation][1] (generated by Doxygen) or
examples in the `examples` directory.

The code uses `assert()`. Make sure to define `NDEBUG` in production code
(e.g. `-DNDEBUG`) to disable it.
